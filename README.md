# Programming

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my programming projects, experiments, and contributions to the vast world of software development. 
Here, you'll find a variety of code snippets, scripts, and full-fledged applications showcasing my skills and interests in programming.

## Projects

### 1. Game Space Invaders
 - **Description**: This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. It aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of battling against waves of alien invaders while defending the Earth.

- **Technologies Used**: 
   - Python: Programming language used for game development.
   - Pygame: Python library for creating games and multimedia applications.
   
- **Features**:
   - Player-controlled spaceship: Navigate left and right to dodge incoming enemy fire and shoot back at the invaders.
   - Alien invaders: Defend Earth from waves of descending alien invaders moving horizontally and slowly advancing downwards.
   - Shields: Take cover behind destructible shields to avoid enemy fire.
   - Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they destroy alien invaders.
   
- **Installation**: 
   1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version X.X or higher).
   2. Install Pygame library using pip: `pip install pygame`.
   3. Clone or download the Space Invaders project files from the GitHub repository.
   4. Navigate to the project directory.
   5. Run the main Python file to start the game.

- **Usage**: 
   - Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally.
   - Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at the alien invaders.
   - Dodge enemy fire while trying to eliminate all the invaders.
   - Use shields strategically to protect the spaceship from incoming attacks.
   - Aim for high scores by destroying as many invaders as possible without getting hit.
